        I made this website just for fun i was asked to build a login page as a college project, it heavly inspired from the japanese anime
        series <a href="https://sel.fandom.com/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain">serial experiment lain</a> and  <a href="https://sel.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wired">'The Wired'</a> is an ever developing, evolving virtual world similar to the real world's current internet of the early 2000s. It can be accessed through a Navi. It is an interconnected network, similar to Internet/World Wide Web. It is an advanced form of communication at the center of the story of Serial Experiments Lain.
